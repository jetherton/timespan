== Description ==
Let you select how you'd like the time span that's displayed on the time line to be computed. Normally Usahidi displays the most active month. This plugin will let you chose to see:
* The last N months
* From date N to date M
* A time span that encompases all reports in the database

== Installation ==
1. Copy the entire /timespan/ directory into your /plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin.

== Changelog ==
v1.1 - 2010/10/26 -  Changed the plugin to handle the switch from <plugin-name>_admin.php to <plugin-name>_settings.php for the name of the admin file.
